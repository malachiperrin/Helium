![helium-logo (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44848986/236069361-a67ec18d-5f2b-4835-9670-98141e278dd9.png)

Helium eliminates the tedious task of manually updating local project databases by providing a command-line app that automates the process. With this app, you can easily update a database table using a CSV file.

## Features

- Simplifies the process of updating database tables for local projects.
- Supports CSV file uploads for data updates.
- Automates the reading and updating of the database table based on the CSV content.
- Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for seamless interaction.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, make sure you have the required prerequisites installed, such as Python, the pip package manager, and your preferred database server. Once the prerequisites are set up, follow the installation instructions provided in the README.md file of the repository.

## Usage

Using the command-line app is straightforward. Place your CSV file in Helium directory and execute the app with the appropriate command. Specify the path to the CSV file using the `--file` flag, and provide the name of the database table to update using the `--table` flag. The app will read the CSV file and automatically update the specified table in the database. Upon completion, you will receive a confirmation message.
